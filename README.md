## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### Continued development

I would like to maybe improve on my accessibility and CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [Regexr](https://regexr.com/) - I wasn't able to get some of the patterns for the inputs the way I wanted, but I got something that was good enough, and I was able to achieve that with this website.
